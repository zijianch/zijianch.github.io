<h1>Project</h1>
</div>
<p>Note: if you are interested in some of these projects, you can require a copy of my paper or source code through email.</p>
<h2>Research Projects </h2>
<p>I'm currently enrolled in two research projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To theoretically develop an improved algorithm of estimating the median and make simulations to test efficiency and robutness.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Status: already designed an algorithm that works, now working on simulations</p>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li><p>To develop a way that can effectively use truncated data to give more precise estimates on certain clinical
characteristics than other existing methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First author, submitted at 2021<i>03</i>28, current status: With Editor</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
<p>but I'm not available to give out too many information until papers are finished and accepted. </p>
